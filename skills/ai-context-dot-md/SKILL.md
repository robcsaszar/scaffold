description: "Create or review CONTEXT.md files — hierarchical, LLM-optimized repository documentation describing what a codebase IS (architecture, domain model, conventions). Dual mode: creates new CONTEXT.md at user-specified path, or reviews existing file for completeness and anti-patterns. Use when user wants to add CONTEXT.md, document codebase architecture for agents, define domain language, or says 'create context', 'review context', 'document this codebase'. Triggers are CONTEXT.md, context file, document architecture, domain model, codebase context."

# AI Context Dot MD

Create or review CONTEXT.md files that give agents the factual substrate needed to reason correctly about code.

---

## Mode Detection

- User provides a **path to an existing CONTEXT.md** → **Review Mode**
- User asks to **create/generate/add** a CONTEXT.md → **Create Mode**
- Ambiguous → ask: `(c)reate a new CONTEXT.md or (r)eview an existing one?`

---

## Create Mode

### Step 1 — Placement

Ask the user: "Where should the CONTEXT.md live?"

```text
(r)oot — broad architecture overview
(p)ath — specific directory (provide path)
(m)ultiple — hierarchical (start with root, then children)
```

If a CONTEXT.md already exists at the chosen path, ask: `File exists. (o)verwrite from scratch / (r)eview and update / (Q)uit?` If review-and-update, switch to Review Mode first, then apply improvements.

If the scope has fewer than 5 files or a single obvious purpose, suggest: `This scope may be too small for a standalone CONTEXT.md — a section in the parent might suffice. (p)roceed anyway / (Q)uit?`

### Step 2 — Analyze

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/knowledge-base.md`](references/knowledge-base.md) for principles and patterns.

Before investigating, ask yourself:

- What would confuse a new agent about this scope?
- What terms mean something different HERE than in general usage?
- What implicit relationships aren't visible from file names alone?

Investigate the target scope:

- Read directory structure, key files, existing docs (README, AGENTS.md)
- Identify the domain model (entities, relationships, naming conventions in code)
- Map architecture (boundaries, data flow, abstractions)
- Note conventions that aren't obvious from code alone
- Find gotchas and known gaps

### Step 3 — Draft

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/template.md`](references/template.md) for structure.

Write sections in priority order:

1. **Overview** — one paragraph, what this scope IS
2. **Language** — domain terms with _Avoid_ alternatives (highest ROI section)
3. **Architecture** — boundaries and data flow
4. **Directory Structure** — purpose map (table format)
5. **Key Patterns** — how things work HERE (not general advice)
6. **Known Gaps** — things that will confuse without warning
7. **Children** — links to nested CONTEXT.md (if hierarchical)

Skip sections that add no value for the specific scope. A 3-section file is fine if those 3 sections are high-signal.

### Step 4 — Validate

Before presenting to user, verify:

- [ ] Every term in Language section appears in actual code (no invented abstractions)
- [ ] No section duplicates what's already in AGENTS.md or README
- [ ] Under 200 lines (if over → split into child CONTEXT.md files)
- [ ] No agent instructions (those belong in AGENTS.md)
- [ ] No setup/install steps (those belong in README)
- [ ] Relationships in Language section match actual code relationships

## Review Mode

### Verification Strategy

To verify Freshness and accuracy, load `codebase-map` (or `codebase-investigation` for deeper tracing). Confirm file paths, symbol names, and architectural claims mentioned in the CONTEXT.md still exist and are current.

### Scoring Dimensions

Evaluate the existing CONTEXT.md on 5 dimensions (1–5 scale):

| Dimension | 5 (Excellent) | 1 (Poor) |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Domain Model** | All key terms defined with Avoid lists; relationships explicit | No Language section or vague definitions |
| **Architecture Signal** | Clear boundaries, data flow, abstractions named | Missing or just lists directory names |
| **Locality** | Scoped to its directory; links to children | Dumps entire project in one file |
| **Freshness** | Matches current code; no stale references | References removed files/patterns |
| **Separation** | Pure facts — no agent rules or setup instructions | Mixed with AGENTS.md/README concerns |

### Anti-Pattern Checklist

Flag if present:

- [ ] README-as-CONTEXT (setup instructions in CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] Tutorial style ("First do X, then Y...")
- [ ] Mixing concerns (agent behavior rules here)
- [ ] Stale references (files/patterns that no longer exist)
- [ ] Flat dump (>200 lines, no hierarchy)
- [ ] Missing Language section (most common gap)
- [ ] API documentation (endpoint details that belong in OpenAPI/JSDoc)

### Output Format

```text
## CONTEXT.md Review: [path]

**Score:** [X/25] ([grade])
| Dimension | Score | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Domain Model | X/5 | ... |
| Architecture Signal | X/5 | ... |
| Locality | X/5 | ... |
| Freshness | X/5 | ... |
| Separation | X/5 | ... |

**Anti-patterns found:** [list or "none"]

**Improvements:**
1. [specific, actionable improvement]
2. ...
```

Grade scale: A (22-25), B (18-21), C (14-17), D (10-13), F (<10)

## Hierarchical Guidance

When a project warrants multiple CONTEXT.md files:

- Root = architecture overview + domain model + child links
- Children = focused scope (one package, one domain, one layer)
- Never repeat child content in parent — link with one-line summary
- Suggest hierarchy only when project has 3+ distinct domains or packages

---

## NEVER

- **NEVER include agent behavior instructions in CONTEXT.md**
  **Instead:** Move rules/commands to AGENTS.md; keep CONTEXT purely factual.
  **Why:** Mixing concerns means agents load behavioral rules when they only need facts, causing instruction conflicts.

- **NEVER write tutorial-style prose ("First you...", "To do X, run...")**
  **Instead:** State facts: "X calls Y via Z" or "Authentication uses JWT with 24h expiry."
  **Why:** Tutorial style signals README/AGENTS.md content; agents can't extract architecture facts from procedural text.

- **NEVER invent domain terms not found in actual code**
  **Instead:** Grep the codebase for entity names before defining Language section.
  **Why:** Invented abstractions cause agents to generate code using names that don't exist, creating confusion.

- **NEVER exceed 200 lines in a single CONTEXT.md**
  **Instead:** Split into child CONTEXT.md files linked from a parent.
  **Why:** LLMs load entire files — bloated context wastes tokens and dilutes signal.

- **NEVER duplicate README content (setup, install, contributing)**
  **Instead:** Reference README for those concerns; CONTEXT.md covers what IS, not how to START.
  **Why:** Duplication drifts — one gets updated, the other becomes a lie.

- **NEVER create CONTEXT.md without noting the maintenance obligation**
  **Instead:** End create mode with: "Update this file in the same PR that changes architecture."
  **Why:** Stale CONTEXT.md is worse than no CONTEXT.md — agents trust it and make wrong decisions.

## Do NOT Load

- `references/knowledge-base.md` — only needed during Create Mode Step 2
- `references/template.md` — only needed during Create Mode Step 3
- `references/example.md` — load ONLY if user asks for an example or you need inspiration for a specific section
- In Review Mode, load `references/knowledge-base.md` only if you need to verify anti-patterns or compare against best practices — not for every review
